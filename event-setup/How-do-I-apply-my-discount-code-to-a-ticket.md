# How do I apply my discount code to a ticket?


To apply a discount or access code to your order, find the event you'd like to register for and click the "Enter promotional code" link. Then enter the discount or access code into the text field, and click "Apply." If the promotional code you entered was applied successfully, you'll see a ticket at a discounted price or a brand new ticket will appear.
