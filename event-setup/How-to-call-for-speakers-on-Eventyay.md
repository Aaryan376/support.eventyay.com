# How to Call for Speakers on Eventyay
In the article [How can I create an event](/event-setup/How-can-I-create-an-event.md), we have gone through the four parts we need to include in each event, which are: **Basic Details**, **Attendee Form**, **Sponsors**, and **Sessions & Speakers**. In this article, we will go into details how to add and publish the `Call for Speakers` under **Sessions & Speakers** section.

First, select the event you want to edit under your events management dashboard. Turn on its Sessions & Speakers to set up the `Call for Speakers`.
