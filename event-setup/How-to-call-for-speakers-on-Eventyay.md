# How to Call for Speakers on Eventyay
In the article [How can I create an event](/event-setup/How-can-I-create-an-event.md), we have gone through the four parts we need to include in each event, which are: **Basic Details**, **Attendee Form**, **Sponsors**, and **Sessions & Speakers**. In this article, we will go into details how to add and publish the `Call for Speakers` under **Sessions & Speakers** section.

First, select the event you want to edit under your events management dashboard. Turn on its Sessions & Speakers to set up the `Call for Speakers`.

## Sessions, Microlocations, Session Types
Now you are required to provide inputs for **Tracks**, **Microlocations**, and **Session Types**. Hit the `+` to add one or more categories under each section or `-` button to delete them.

### Tracks 
Adding all the tracks that you are going to host during your event and give a different color to each of them

### Microlocations
Provide details such as room names and their dedicated floors in the building (event's venue).

### Session Types
Add the sessions types that speakers/presenters can choose from. Typically, there are `Standard Talk`, `Lightning Talk` and `Workshop`. You can also add more session types of your preferences.

## Call for Speakers 
Next, you can start to add  description for the `Call for Speakers` into the **Annoucement** box, set its start/end time and select the
timezone. Here, you can also decide whether you want to display the `Call for Speakers` publicly or make privately. If you set the `Call
for Speakers` as private, proposals can only be submitted via the private link.

## Customize Registration Form
The last step to complete before publishing the `Call for Speakers` is to customize the registration form. There are two columns of
information that you can customize, which are: **Collect Speaker Details** and **Collect Session Details** respectively.
