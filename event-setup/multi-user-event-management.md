# How do I allow multi-user access to manage the event

First, you need to create an event.

Now, navigate to your event dashboard and scroll down to "Manage Roles" section.

Click on "Add People" button on the top-right corner of the section. It opens up a pop-up window where you can enter the email address of the user you want to add to the event managers, and select appropriate role.
