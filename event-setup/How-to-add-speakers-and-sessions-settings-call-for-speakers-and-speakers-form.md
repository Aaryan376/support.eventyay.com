# How to add speakers and sessions settings, call for speakers and speakers form?

In the article [How can I create an event](/event-setup/How-can-I-create-an-event?.md), we have gone through the four parts we need to include in each event, which are: **Basic Details**, **Attendee Form**, **Sponsors**, and **Sessions & Speakers**. In this article, we will go into details how to add and publish the `Call for Speakers` under **Sessions & Speakers** section.

First, select the event you want to edit under your events management dashboard. Turn on its Sessions & Speakers to set up the `Call for Speakers`.

## Call for Speakers 
Next, you can start to add  description for the `Call for Speakers` into the **Annoucement** box, set its start/end time and select the
timezone. Here, you can also decide whether you want to display the `Call for Speakers` publicly or make privately. If you set the `Call
for Speakers` as private, proposals can only be submitted via the private link.
